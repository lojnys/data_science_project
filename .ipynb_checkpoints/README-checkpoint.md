In this project, I will be constructing a predictive model for an online competition, posted on *Kaggle*, to answer the following question:

***"What sorts of people were more likely to survive?"***

In this competition, I gained access to two datasets (`train.csv` and `test.csv`). The `train.csv` file contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board and also contains information whether they have survived or not.The `test.csv` file contains similar information but does not disclose the survival status of each passenger. I will be conducting statistical analysis and applying supervised machine learning algorithms to train and predict the "unknown" labels in `test.csv`. 

Datasets contain:
|Variable|Definition|
|------|------|
|`survived`|whether the passenger survived or not (0 = No, 1 = Yes)|
|`pclass`|passenger's ticket class (1 = Upper, 2 = Middle, 3 = Lower)|
|`sex`|passenger's sex|
|`age`|passenger's age|
|`sibsp`|number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic|
|`parch`|number of parents/children aboard the Titanic|
|`ticket`|passenger's ticket number|
|`fare`|passenger fare|
|`cabin`|cabin number|
|`embarked`|port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)|
